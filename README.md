# Travel The World.

This is the landing page of a blog site called "Travel The World". This was a demo project for the FNB app academy that I decided to try and recreate. I've slightly adjusted the UI to make it a little more mordern as I felt it was a little out of date. 
It is responsive for screens up until 1080px width. 

### TechStack Used 
I used HTML and CSS. 

### Extra Notes And Info
Note: None of the links on the site work as this is just a 'template'
